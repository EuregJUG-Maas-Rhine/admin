## About

This are the sources of the administrative backend for [euregjug.eu](http://euregjug.eu).

This application is based on [OracleJET](http://www.oraclejet.com).

At the time of writing it uses only the unprotected endpoints of the api but plan is to add OAuth on the backend and use it from this app.

The admin application itself runs - as its backend - on [Pivotal CF](https://run.pivotal.io), served by the static build pack.
